#summary Known bugs and limitations

== Bugs only on mono ==

 * Html.!AntiforgeryToken helper does not work under mono
 * Lazy loading in NHibernate doesn't work under mono. By default it is therefore disabled.
 * Under mono the return_to parameter while initiating an OpenID reuest will incorrectly contain "!UrlRouting.axd" too. You have to explicitly add the return_to parameter when constructing the request with !OpenIdRelyingParty.!CreateRequest

== !ToDo ==

 * The !MembershipAdministration controller uses GET commands to update the Memberships. It needs urgent refactoring.
 * Add support for alternative databases like SQLite

#summary How to create a S#aml-architecture application

= Introduction =

To create a shaml application use the shaml command line utility to generate an application:
{{{
shaml generate app NewApp
}}}

this will create a NewApp directory with the complete s#aml-architecture stack. Open the solution in VS.NET2008, compile, deploy on your mono box and you're ready to go.

The shaml command can also create REST-styled resources. Run the following inside your solution directory:
{{{
shaml generate resource resname name:string;date:DateTime
}}}

This will create a new model called Resname, with two properties. It will also create a scaffold view, unit tests, and a controller to handle editing the resource.

Apart from the installation, s#aml-architecture uses the same things as s#arp-architecture, Fluent NHibernate, dotNetOpenAuth and of course ASP.NET MVC, so check their documentations too for more.

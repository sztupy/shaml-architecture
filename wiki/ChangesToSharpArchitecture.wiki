#summary Changes from S#arp Architecture

= Changes from S#arp Architecture =

The project's 0.5.0 GA version is based on S#arp Architecture 1.5 beta 1

 * The support library's names are Shaml, instead of !SharpArch
 * Shaml uses !LinFu.IoC instead of Castle.Windsor because the latter had issues working on mono. Although !LinFu has fever features it is lightweight and works well with Shaml
 * Shaml uses an integrated NHibernate based Membership/Role/Session/Profile Provider, that resides in Shaml.Membership
 * Shaml is more coupled with NHibernate and the NUnit testing framework (this might sound a bad design choice but it makes testing for mono compatiblity much easier)
 * Shaml has an extended IRepository`<T>` class to allow easy pagination, and searching
 * Shaml has client side validation support for NHibernate Validator
 * Built-in optionated OpenID support
  * Uses !DotNetOpenAuth
  * Uses a modified Membership provider to support multiple OpenID's per one identity
 * NHaml is the default view engine
  * The default view engine is still supported
 * Uses the [http://compass-style.org Compass] stylesheet framework to build css stylesheets
 * Uses a ruby based tool to create the CRUD scaffolds instead of !T4Toolkit
 * Alternative directory structure

#summary Benchmark

Don't take these results too seriously, because they were not run in a controlled environment.

A similar blog which was showed at the [http://shaml.sztupy.hu/tutorial-start.html tutorial] was created in rails, merb and S#aml. The benchmark used was {{{ab}}} with the following parameters:

{{{
ab -c 20 -n 2000 website
}}}

The mean requests per second results were the following (best results from three runs):
 * rails using mod_rails: 7.86  `[#/sec] (mean)`
 * merb  using mod_rack: 9.75  `[#/sec] (mean)`
 * shaml using xsp2: 19.51  `[#/sec] (mean)`
 * shaml using mod_mono: 20.32  `[#/sec] (mean)`

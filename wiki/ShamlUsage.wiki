#summary How to create a S#aml Architecture application

The complete list of shaml commands can be found at the [http://shaml.sztupy.hu/api/index.html API documentation page]

= Create application =

== With the generator app ==

To create a shaml application use the shaml command line utility to generate an application:
{{{
shaml generate app NewApp
}}}

this will create a !NewApp directory with the complete S#aml Architecture stack. 

The shaml command can also create REST-styled resources. Run the following inside your solution directory:
{{{
shaml generate resource resname "name:string;date:DateTime"
}}}

This will create a new model called Resname, with two properties. It will also create a scaffold view, unit tests, and a controller to handle editing the resource.

Apart from the installation, S#aml Architecture uses the same things as S#arp Architecture, Fluent NHibernate, DotNetOpenAuth and of course ASP.NET MVC 2, so check their documentations for more information. You can also read about the [GoodToKnow differences] between S#arp Architecture and Shaml.

== Without the generator application ==

Alternatively you can download the bare solution file from [http://github.com/sztupy/shaml/downloads github]. Extract the zip file, and you're ready. You won't have neither the CRUD generator nor the Compass framework without ruby though.

= Compiling =

== Windows ==

Open the solution, and press build.

== Mono ==

Run
{{{
shaml compile
}}}
in the solution directory to compile both the application and the tests.

If you don't use ruby then run
{{{
xbuild ProjetName.sln
}}}
from the main Web directory.

= Running =

== Windows ==

Press run in Visual Studio

== Mono ==

Run 
{{{
shaml server
}}}

in the solution directory or run

{{{
MONO_PATH="/path/to/app/bin" xsp2 --port 8080
}}}

in the web application project directory

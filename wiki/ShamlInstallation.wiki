#summary How to download install S#aml Architecture

= Introduction =

Things you will need:
 * mono 2.4.4, mono 2.6.3+ or .NET 3.5
For the CRUD generator and compass frameworks:
 * ruby 1.8.6 or mono 1.8.7 (mono 1.9.x should work too)
 * rubygems

= Installation =

== Install with the CRUD and Application generator ==

Linux:
{{{
sudo gem install shaml
}}}

Windows:
{{{
gem install shaml
}}}

This will install shaml, compass and haml on your computer.

== Install without ruby ==

Alternatively you can get the bare application without any fancy generation framework. Download the latest VS2008 solution from [http://github.com/sztupy/shaml/downloads github]

Don't forget that if you don't have compass installed, then the stylesheet generation build process will always fail. Remove the command "compass --update" from the post build process if you don't use it.
